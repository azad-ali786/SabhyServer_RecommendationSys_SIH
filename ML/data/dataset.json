The goal of this course is to empower the participants to analyze the risks of unethical or illegal behavior that might be triggered by powerful contexts.

Whenever we hear about ethical scandals, we tend to believe that unethical or illegal behaviour in organizations is driven by character deficiencies of individual actors.

However, numerous corporate scandals have demonstrated that even people with a high level of integrity can break the rules if they are put into a strong context. A better understanding of why and under what conditions good people make bad ethical decisions will enable us to better protect individuals as well as their respective organizations against the potentially overwhelming power of the context. It will also enable us to cure societies from problems like corruption. At the end of the course, you are able to: 1. Explain the impact of social context on individual decision making using various theories (from Management, Sociology, Psychology, and Philosophy) 2. Apply these theories to the analysis of some of the most eminent organizational scandals of the recent decades 3. Assess risks of ethical blindness in your own organizational context 4. Design interventions to reduce such risks for yourself and your organization Recommended Background No background expertise is required. The course is open for interested layperson as well as experts who work on related topics, be it as researchers or practitioners (e.g., compliance managers in corporations). Why is this course important for me? Currently, the understanding of why good people make unethical decisions is rather limited, related research is rather fragmented, and the management of such problems in organizations is overly simplistic, legalistic, and inadequate. Understanding contexts, including the dangers of routines, the mindlessness of our daily decisions, and the healing power of mindful decision-making routines is of increasing importance. In this course, you will learn the latest knowledge and the appropriate tool box for dealing with ethical challenges that you will face throughout your life! What do I need to follow this course? We build bridges between various scientific disciplines and will familiarize you with those disciplines smoothly. You need no expertise, just come and share your own real-world experiences about unethical decisions.

However, domain adaptation\n(DA) is needed to alleviate the problem of domain shifts that typically occurs\nbetween video data captured in source and target do-mains. Given the laborious\ntask of collecting and annotating videos, and the subjective bias due to\nambiguity among adjacent intensity levels, weakly-supervised learning (WSL)is\ngaining attention in such applications. Yet, most state-of-the-art WSL models\nare typically formulated as regression problems, and do not leverage the\nordinal relation between intensity levels, nor the temporal coherence of\nmultiple consecutive frames. This paper introduces a new deep learn-ing model\nfor weakly-supervised DA with ordinal regression(WSDA-OR), where videos in\ntarget domain have coarse la-bels provided on a periodic basis. The WSDA-OR\nmodel enforces ordinal relationships among the intensity levels as-signed to\nthe target sequences, and associates multiple relevant frames to sequence-level\nlabels (instead of a single frame). In particular, it learns discriminant and\ndomain-invariant feature representations by integrating multiple in-stance\nlearning with deep adversarial DA, where soft Gaussian labels are used to\nefficiently represent the weak ordinal sequence-level labels from the target\ndomain. The proposed approach was validated on the RECOLA video dataset as\nfully-labeled source domain, and UNBC-McMaster video data as weakly-labeled\ntarget domain. We have also validated WSDA-OR on BIOVID and Fatigue (private)\ndatasets for sequence level estimation.

Previous methods usually generate an initial image with sentence\nembedding and then refine it with fine-grained word embedding. Despite the\nsignificant progress, the 'aspect' information (e.g., red eyes) contained in\nthe text, referring to several words rather than a word that depicts 'a\nparticular part or feature of something', is often ignored, which is highly\nhelpful for synthesizing image details. How to make better utilization of\naspect information in text-to-image synthesis still remains an unresolved\nchallenge. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a Dynamic\nAspect-awarE GAN (DAE-GAN) that represents text information comprehensively\nfrom multiple granularities, including sentence-level, word-level, and\naspect-level. Moreover, inspired by human learning behaviors, we develop a\nnovel Aspect-aware Dynamic Re-drawer (ADR) for image refinement, in which an\nAttended Global Refinement (AGR) module and an Aspect-aware Local Refinement\n(ALR) module are alternately employed. AGR utilizes word-level embedding to\nglobally enhance the previously generated image, while ALR dynamically employs\naspect-level embedding to refine image details from a local perspective.\nFinally, a corresponding matching loss function is designed to ensure the\ntext-image semantic consistency at different levels. Extensive experiments on\ntwo well-studied and publicly available datasets (i.e., CUB-200 and COCO)\ndemonstrate the superiority and rationality of our method.","file":"hashfile1","__v":0,"hardware":"False"},{"fileIdx":100,"thumbnail":"https:\/\/uploads7.wikiart.org\/00244\/images\/ancient-egyptian-painting\/ancient-egypt-198-18168336196.jpg","author":["testing"],"keyWords":["Web","Direct","example-packed"],"interests":["App Dev"],"minumunContribution":1,"downloadCount":0,"viewCount":0,"subscriberInsti":[],"subscriberUser":[],"_id":"2s182exkol","intiId":[],"idEth":"def","name":"DWR Java AJAX Applications","desc":"A step-by-step example-packed guide to learning professional application development with Direct Web...","file":"hashfile1","__v":0,"hardware":"False"},{"fileIdx":101,"thumbnail":"https:\/\/uploads2.wikiart.org\/00244\/images\/ancient-egyptian-painting\/fragment-of-a-doorjamb-from-the-tomb-of-djehutynefer-ca-1450-1390-b-c.jpg","author":["testing"],"keyWords":["segmentation","image","CNN"],"interests":["Deep Learning"],"minumunContribution":1,"downloadCount":0,"viewCount":0,"subscriberInsti":[],"subscriberUser":[],"_id":"0tjihjthdb","intiId":[],"idEth":"def","name":"Near Real-time Hippocampus Segmentation Using Patch-based Canonical Neural Network","desc":"Over the past decades, state-of-the-art medical image segmentation has\nheavily rested on signal processing paradigms, most notably registration-based\nlabel propagation and pair-wise patch comparison, which are generally slow\ndespite a high segmentation accuracy.

From the earliest days of the profession, Luca Pacioli emphasized the importance of math and order for analyzing business transactions. The skillset that accountants have needed to perform math and to keep order has evolved from pencil and paper, to typewriters and calculators, then to spreadsheets and accounting software. A new skillset that is becoming more important for nearly every aspect of business is that of big data analytics: analyzing large amounts of data to find actionable insights. This course is designed to help accounting students develop an analytical mindset and prepare them to use data analytic programming languages like Python and R. We\ufffdve divided the course into three main sections. In the first section, we bridge accountancy to analytics. We identify how tasks in the five major subdomains of accounting (i.e., financial, managerial, audit, tax, and systems) have historically required an analytical mindset, and we then explore how those tasks can be completed more effectively and efficiently by using big data analytics. We then present a FACT framework for guiding big data analytics: Frame a question, Assemble data, Calculate the data, and Tell others about the results. In the second section of the course, we emphasize the importance of assembling data. Using financial statement data, we explain desirable characteristics of both data and datasets that will lead to effective calculations and visualizations. In the third, and largest section of the course, we demonstrate and explore how Excel and Tableau can be used to analyze big data. We describe visual perception principles and then apply those principles to create effective visualizations.

Firstly, the calculations without\nincluding spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are presented where the highest TMR is\nachieved in IrMn-IrMn MTJ compared to that of Ta-Ta, W-W and Mo-Mo MTJs. The\norigin of this large TMR is attributed to, both, the large spin-polarization\ndue to reduced lattice-mismatch and the non-identical signatures of both the\nanti-parallel conduction-channels caused by the anti-ferromagnetic ordering of\nIrMn that reflects the spins at IrMn\/FeCo interface. Moreover, when SOC is\nswitched-on, the increase of TMR is observed in all the MTJs with a\nparticularly giant enhancement in IrMn-IrMn MTJ. This SOC-induced increase in\nTMR is ascribed to the mixed contribution of $\\Delta_1$ and $\\Delta_5$ states\nand the additional increase in the band levels of the out-of-plane orbitals,\n\\emph{p}$_z$, \\emph{d}$_{z}^2$ and \\emph{d}$_{xz}$ due to the lifting of\ndegeneracy.

Based on our findings, we propose a\nDRL-based HM prediction (DHP) approach with offline and online versions, called\noffline-DHP and online-DHP. In offline-DHP, multiple DRL workflows are run to\ndetermine potential HM positions at each panoramic frame. Then, a heat map of\nthe potential HM positions, named the HM map, is generated as the output of\noffline-DHP. In online-DHP, the next HM position of one subject is estimated\ngiven the currently observed HM position, which is achieved by developing a DRL\nalgorithm upon the learned offline-DHP model. Finally, the experiments validate\nthat our approach is effective in both offline and online prediction of HM\npositions for panoramic video, and that the learned offline-DHP model can\nimprove the performance of online-DHP.","file":"hashfile1","__v":0,"hardware":"False"},{"fileIdx":172,"thumbnail":"https:\/\/uploads0.wikiart.org\/00237\/images\/ancient-greek-painting\/a-color-reconstruction-of-a-lion-loutraki-ca-550-bc-2.jpg","author":["testing"],"keyWords":["Connection","Machine","computer"],"interests":["CS Fundamentals"],"minumunContribution":1,"downloadCount":0,"viewCount":0,"subscriberInsti":[],"subscriberUser":[],"_id":"hp1ze6u5iy","intiId":[],"idEth":"def","name":"The Connection Machine","desc":"The Connection Machine describes a fundamentally different kind of computer.

It will be laborious to cope with the\nheterogeneous requirements in next-generation wireless communications, such as\nvarious transmission data, complicated communication scenarios, and massive\nuser access. Therefore, this paper studies a generalized MU-MIMO (GMU-MIMO)\nsystem with more practical constraints, i.e., non-Gaussian signaling, non-IID\nchannel, and massive users and antennas. These generalized assumptions bring\nnew challenges in theory and practice. For example, there is no accurate\ncapacity analysis for GMU-MIMO. In addition, it is unclear how to achieve the\ncapacity optimal performance with practical complexity.\nTo address these challenges, a unified framework is proposed to derive the\nGMU-MIMO capacity and design a capacity optimal transceiver, which jointly\nconsiders encoding, modulation, detection, and decoding. Group asymmetry is\ndeveloped to make a tradeoff between user rate allocation and implementation\ncomplexity. Specifically, the capacity region of group asymmetric GMU-MIMO is\ncharacterized by using the celebrated mutual information and minimum\nmean-square error (MMSE) lemma and the MMSE optimality of orthogonal\napproximate message passing (OAMP)\/vector AMP (VAMP). Furthermore, a\ntheoretically optimal multi-user OAMP\/VAMP receiver and practical multi-user\nlow-density parity-check (MU-LDPC) codes are proposed to achieve the capacity\nregion of group asymmetric GMU-MIMO. Numerical results verify that the gaps\nbetween theoretical detection thresholds of the proposed framework with\noptimized MU-LDPC codes and QPSK modulation and the sum capacity of GMU-MIMO\nare about 0.2 dB.

Any instance of MTS is generated from a hybrid\ndynamical system and their specific dynamics are usually unknown. The hybrid\nnature of such a dynamical system is a result of complex external attributes,\nsuch as geographic location and time of day, each of which can be categorized\ninto either spatial attributes or temporal attributes. Therefore, there are two\nfundamental views which can be used to analyze MTS data, namely the spatial\nview and the temporal view. Moreover, from each of these two views, we can\npartition the set of data samples of MTS into disjoint forecasting tasks in\naccordance with their associated attribute values. Then, samples of the same\ntask will manifest similar forthcoming pattern, which is less sophisticated to\nbe predicted in comparison with the original single-view setting. Considering\nthis insight, we propose a novel multi-view multi-task (MVMT) learning\nframework for MTS forecasting. Instead of being explicitly presented in most\nscenarios, MVMT information is deeply concealed in the MTS data, which severely\nhinders the model from capturing it naturally. To this end, we develop two\nkinds of basic operations, namely task-wise affine transformation and task-wise\nnormalization, respectively. Applying these two operations with prior knowledge\non the spatial and temporal view allows the model to adaptively extract MVMT\ninformation while predicting. Extensive experiments on three datasets are\nconducted to illustrate that canonical architectures can be greatly enhanced by\nthe MVMT learning framework in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

This non-linear transformation of the data\nis both the key of these algorithms' success and their Achilles heel: forming a\ngraph and computing its dominant eigenvectors can indeed be computationally\nprohibitive when dealing with more that a few tens of thousands of points. In\nthis paper, we review the principal research efforts aiming to reduce this\ncomputational cost. We focus on methods that come with a theoretical control on\nthe clustering performance and incorporate some form of sampling in their\noperation. Such methods abound in the machine learning, numerical linear\nalgebra, and graph signal processing literature and, amongst others, include\nNystr\\\"om-approximation, landmarks, coarsening, coresets, and compressive\nspectral clustering. We present the approximation guarantees available for each\nand discuss practical merits and limitations. Surprisingly, despite the breadth\nof the literature explored, we conclude that there is still a gap between\ntheory and practice: the most scalable methods are only intuitively motivated\nor loosely controlled, whereas those that come with end-to-end guarantees rely\non strong assumptions or enable a limited gain of computation time.","file":"hashfile1","__v":0,"hardware":"False"}]
